# WS2S CLI Integration

This document outlines the proposed "What You See Is What You See" (WS2S) paradigm for the LibPolyCall command line interface.

## Goals
- Provide real time visual feedback for every CLI command.
- Ensure command semantics are clear (WYSIWYM: What You See Is What You Mean).
- Maintain OBINexus constitutional compliance and accessibility.

## Command Pattern
Each command follows the pattern:

```bash
./polycall <domain> <action> <target> [options]
```

Example:

```bash
./polycall protocol init --guid=auto --telemetry=enabled
```

## Visual Feedback
A small progress indicator should reflect completion percentage along with constitutional status indicators:

```
[●●●○○] 40% | protocol init | GUID: <id> | ✓ Constitutional | ✓ A11Y
```

## Accessibility
Output should be screen‑reader friendly and optionally provide audio notifications. High contrast mode should be available when the terminal supports it.

## Dark Psychology Mitigation
Commands must disclose their intent before execution and request explicit consent for sensitive operations.
